# Nine-letter-words
A python script for solving x-letter word puzzles (ie where you are given a letter matrix and are asked to find all of the words which can be made using the provided letters at most once). Uses PyEnchant spellchecking library and Itertools library

The script is currently initialised to work with The Age's Target Time puzzle, so it includes 9 letters with the first letter being mandatory and words must be at least 4 letters long. 
The number of letters can be altered for it to work with The New York Times' Spelling Bee or other similar puzzles. 

To use the script, dowload the code and edit the letters in the list 'given_letters'. The first letter in this list is used as the mandatory letter. 

Enjoy!
